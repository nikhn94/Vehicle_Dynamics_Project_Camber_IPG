The above folder contain the data for sine sweep and step response tests in xls as well as csv format.
I have also uploaded a matlab file to load and plot all data.
Each file corresponds to a single camber angle test with values of:
- Velocity
- SideSlip
- Yaw Rate
- Lateral Acceleration (ay)
- Steer Angle
- Time

Below the maneuvers taken are listed for each test:

Step Response Test  
START
1. Acceleration to 80 km/h
2. Steady-state condition for 10 secs
3. Steer step to 20 deg
4. Hold for 10 secs
5. Back to 0 deg steering
6. Hold for 10 secs

END



Sine Sweep Test  
START
1. Acceleration to 80 km/h
2. Steady-state condition for 10 secs
3. Sine Sweep with amplitude of 50 deg with frequency from 1Hz to 5Hz
4. Back to 0 deg steering and hold for 10 secs

END
