* Please note:
1. The values are for a total from standing still to accelerate to 50kmph and then enter turn of radius 30m
2. In the turn the speed increases from 50kmph to 60kmph beyond which the car moves out of the course.
3. In the graph, the value becomes constant after a certain lateral acceleration. That is when the simulation stops and hence lateral acceleration goes to zero.
4. Data is extracted as per steady state circular test for vehicle stability at its limit.
5. Circle speed profile increase is the speed profile of the car in the curve.
6. The car is in understeer configuration.
7. Simulation run time is for total of 25s.
8. Video is for neutral camber( 0 camber).
