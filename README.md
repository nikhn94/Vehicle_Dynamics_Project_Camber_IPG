# Vehicle-Dyanmics-Project

## Introduction

This project is a collaboration of MSc students of Mechanical Engineering at TU Delft, including Varun Kotian, Nikhil Nagendra, Shantanu Shivankar , Yen-Lin Wu, and a master student at KTH, Filip Berggren. 
This is a repository for the final project of the course Vehicle Dynamics (ME41100) at TU Delft.
This report studies the driving experience of different camber angles (-10 deg to 10 deg) on a sports car in 3 different driving scenarios: 
1. a steady-state turn,
2. a step steering response,
3. a sinusoidal steering response.

The simulation is conducted on IPG CarMaker software, whose results (in .csv) are uploaded and sorted in folders.


## Abstract

This report studies the driving experience of different camber angles on a sports car in different driving scenarios. The camber angle is varied between -10 to 10 degrees and the tests are performed in three different driving scenarios: 
1. a constant turn, 
2. a step steer response, 
3. a sinusoidal steer response.

To evaluate the driving experience, the following performance indicators are analyzed: 
1. yaw velocity, 
2. yaw velocity response gain, 
3. yaw velocity overshoot ratio,
4. lateral acceleration response time, 
5. lateral acceleration overshoot. 

The study concludes that a more negative camber angle results in a sportier driver experience but also yields a more oversteered behaviour.
